# FCSH 
No.1 Deep Learning to Full-Convolution Semantic Hash Algorithm

Tensorflow implementation for FCSH
- running environment: Tensorflow 1.8.0 and python 3.6.3

- please run several times and take the average (as the result is a little bit unstable)

- you can download the [ImageNet](https://github.com/thuml/HashNet/tree/master/caffe) and [cifar-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset  and please extract the file in /home/${user}/work/data/${dataset_name}
